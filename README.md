project involves a task management system where users can add, delete, and update tasks for today and tomorrow. Key features of the project include:

Task Management: Users can add, update, and delete tasks stored in two tables: "today's tasks" and "tomorrow's tasks."
Notification System: The system notifies users when tasks are due using browser notifications. Notifications can also play sounds.
Countdown Timer: There is a countdown timer that shows the remaining time for tasks to be completed.
Overdue Marking: Tasks that are overdue are visually marked by changing the background color to red and adding a tick icon.
Auto-fetching: It automatically fetches tasks for today and tomorrow from the database and displays them on the interface.
